# 🧠 OpenCV Python Projects — Ashwin’s Journey

Welcome to my Computer Vision learning journey using **Python + OpenCV**!  
This repository contains hands-on scripts and experiments — from basic image handling to real-time face detection using webcam.

---

## 📂 Contents

- Reading and displaying images
- Saving images in different formats
- Drawing shapes (rectangle, line, circle, text)
- Image transformations (resize, rotate, threshold)
- Image filtering (Gaussian, Median, Bilateral)
- Canny edge detection
- Video reading and saving
- Face detection in images
- Real-time face detection from webcam

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

### ✅ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

---

## 📸 Features

### ✅ Image Processing
- Load, display, and save images
- Draw shapes and add text

### ✅ Filters & Thresholding
- Gaussian Blur
- Median Blur
- Bilateral Filtering
- Thresholding
- Canny Edge Detection

### ✅ Video Processing
- Load and display video frames
- Save processed video in different formats

### ✅ Face Detection
- Detect faces in static images
- Detect faces in real-time from webcam
- Draw bounding boxes and save cropped faces

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python your_script.py
```

For real-time face detection:

```bash
python realtime_face_detection.py
```

> Press `q` to quit webcam window.
